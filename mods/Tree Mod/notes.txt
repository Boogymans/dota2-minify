Turns all trees to small green square bushes

- ONLY works on default terrain you cannot use a custom terrain like desert, immortal gardens..etc 
- shows juke paths and improves GPU performance since these trees don't use as much geometry as default ones.

I plan to add tree mod to all maps in the future.
