Removes many uneeded effects from the game to improve performance, a few examples are.

- Removes particle effects on buildings such as the glowing blue effects on fountain, outpost, base buildings..etc
- Tower attack projectile/destruction particles 
- Effigies particles
- Simplified illusions, helps with fps drops against Naga/PL especially.
- hero loadouts, event emblems...etc

I am often updating more optimizations into the patcher so if you want to see everything go here on github.
